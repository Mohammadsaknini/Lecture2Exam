What is NLP?


What is NLP?
Natural language processing (NLP) is an interdisciplinary subfield of 
computer science and information retrieval. It is primarily concerned with 
giving computers the ability to support and manipulate human language. It 
involves processing natural language datasets, such as text corpora or 
speech corpora, using either rule-based or probabilistic (i.e. statistical and, 
most recently, neural network-based) machine learning approaches. The 
goal is a computer capable of "understanding" the contents of documents, 
including the contextual nuances of the language within them. To this end, 
natural language processing often borrows ideas from theoretical 
linguistics. The technology can then accurately extract information and 
insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the 
documents themselves.

Application Areas, Tasks & 
Examples


Text classification
• Spam classification
• Text Sentiment Analysis
Spam Classifier
Spam
Ham
Classifier
Negative
Positive
Often also as
scoring /
regression variant

[IDS] In the context of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) lecture, the image represents the fundamental concepts of text classification and sentiment analysis. Text classification refers to the process of categorizing text data into predefined categories, such as spam or not spam. In this case, the diagram illustrates how a spam classifier is used to determine whether an email is spam or ham (not spam). The presence of an often also as scoring/regression variant suggests that these classification methods can be extended to include numerical scores or regression analysis.

On the other hand, sentiment analysis focuses on determining the emotional tone or attitude conveyed in a piece of text. The diagram shows a text sentiment analysis with a classifier that categorizes text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. This process is essential for understanding public opinion, customer feedback, and overall sentiment towards a product or service. As we delve into NLP, these concepts form the building blocks for more advanced techniques in understanding and interacting with human language. [IDE]

------------Text_processing------------
Regular expressions are used everywhere
◦Part of every text processing task
◦Not a general NLP solution (for that we use large NLP 
systems we will see in later lectures)
◦But very useful as part of those systems (e.g., for pre-
processing or text formatting)
◦Necessary for data analysis of text data
◦A widely used tool in industry and academics

Regular expressions
A formal language for specifying text strings
How can we search for mentions of these cute animals in text?
◦woodchuck
◦woodchucks
◦Woodchuck
◦Woodchucks
◦Groundhog
◦groundhogs

[IDS] In the context of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) lecture, the image represents a visual aid used to explain how to search for specific patterns or expressions within text data. The beaver, as a symbol of hard work and diligence, may metaphorically represent the meticulous process of searching through text strings using regular expressions. This technique is crucial in NLP for tasks such as data preprocessing, pattern matching, and text analysis. [IDE]

[IDS] The image displays a slide from a lecture on Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically focusing on text processing techniques. It introduces the concept of wildcards and optionality in regular expressions, which are crucial for pattern matching in text data. The slide outlines how to use these concepts to match different patterns, such as any character, optional sequences, zero or more occurrences of a previous character, and one or more occurrences of a previous character. These patterns are essential in NLP for tasks like tokenization, parsing, and search algorithms. The examples provided demonstrate how to apply these patterns in regular expressions. The presence of the name "Stephen C Kleene" suggests that the lecture might be discussing the contributions of Stephen Kleene, a mathematician known for his work on regular expressions and formal languages.

A note about Python regular expressions
◦Regex and Python both use backslash "\" for 
special characters. You must type extra backslashes!
◦"\\d+"  to search for 1 or more digits
◦"\n" in Python means the "newline" character, not a 
"slash" followed by an "n". Need "\\n" for two characters.
◦Instead: use Python's raw string notation for regex:
◦r"[tT]he"
◦r"\d+" matches one or more digits
◦instead of "\\d+"
10


The iterative process of writing regex's
Find me all instances of the word “the” in a text.
the
Misses capitalized examples
[tT]he
Incorrectly returns other or Theology
\W[tT]he\W


False positives and false negatives
The process we just went through was based on 
fixing two kinds of errors:
1. Not matching things that we should have matched 
(The)
False negatives
2. Matching strings that we should not have matched 
(there, then, other)
False positives


Characterizing work on NLP
In NLP we are always dealing with these kinds of errors.
Reducing the error rate for an application often 
involves two antagonistic efforts: 
◦Increasing coverage (or recall) (minimizing false negatives).
◦Increasing accuracy (or precision) (minimizing false positives)


Regular expressions play a surprisingly large role
Widely used in both academics and industry
1. Part of most text processing tasks, even for big 
neural language model pipelines
◦including text formatting and pre-processing
2. Very useful for data analysis of any text data

• a specific writer(s), 
• at a specific time, 
• in a specific variety,
• of a specific language, 
• for a specific function.


Corpora vary along dimension like
◦Language: 7097 languages in the world
◦Variety, like African American Language varieties.
◦AAE Twitter posts might include forms like "iont" (I don't)
◦Code switching, e.g., Spanish/English, Hindi/English:
 
S/E: Por primera vez veo a @username actually being hateful! It was beautiful:) 
 
   [For the first time I get to see @username actually being hateful! it was beautiful:) ] 
 
H/E: dost tha or ra- hega ... dont wory ... but dherya rakhe 
 
   [“he was and will remain a friend ... don’t worry ... but have faith”] 
◦Genre: newswire, fiction, scientific articles, Wikipedia
◦Author Demographics: writer's age, gender, ethnicity, SES 


Corpus datasheets
Motivation: 
• Why was the corpus collected?
• By whom? 
• Who funded it? 
Situation: In what situation was the text written?
Collection process: If it is a subsample how was it sampled? Was 
there consent? Pre-processing?
   +Annotation process, language variety, demographics, etc.

Word tokenization


Text Normalization
Every NLP task requires text normalization: 
1. Tokenizing (segmenting) words
2. Normalizing word formats
3. Segmenting sentences


Space-based tokenization
A very simple way to tokenize
◦For languages that use space characters between words
◦Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek, Latin, etc., based writing systems
◦Segment off a token between instances of spaces
Unix tools for space-based tokenization
◦The "tr" command
◦Inspired by Ken Church's UNIX for Poets
◦Given a text file, output the word tokens and their frequencies

Tokenization in NLTK
ficient finite state automata. For example, Fig. 2.12 shows an example of a basic
regular expression that can be used to tokenize with the nltk.regexp tokenize
function of the Python-based Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) (Bird et al. 2009;
http://www.nltk.org).
>>> text = ’That U.S.A. poster-print costs $12.40...’
>>> pattern = r’’’(?x)
# set flag to allow verbose regexps
...
([A-Z]\.)+
# abbreviations, e.g. U.S.A.
...
| \w+(-\w+)*
# words with optional internal hyphens
...
| \$?\d+(\.\d+)?%?
# currency and percentages, e.g. $12.40, 82%
...
| \.\.\.
# ellipsis
...
| [][.,;"’?():-_‘]
# these are separate tokens; includes ], [
... ’’’
>>> nltk.regexp_tokenize(text, pattern)
[’That’, ’U.S.A.’, ’poster-print’, ’costs’, ’$12.40’, ’...’]

Carefully designed deterministic algorithms can deal with the ambiguities that
arise, such as the fact that the apostrophe needs to be tokenized differently when used

Tokenization in languages without spaces 
Many languages (like Chinese, Japanese, Thai) don't 
use spaces to separate words!
How do we decide where the token boundaries 
should be?


Word tokenization in Chinese
Chinese words are composed of characters called 
"hanzi" (or sometimes just "zi")
Each one represents a meaning unit called a morpheme.
Each word has on average 2.4 of them.
But deciding what counts as a word is complex and not 
agreed upon.

Word tokenization / segmentation
So in Chinese it's common to just treat each character 
(zi) as a token.
• So the segmentation step is very simple
In other languages (like Thai and Japanese), more 
complex word segmentation is required.
• The standard algorithms are neural sequence models 
trained by supervised machine learning.

Word Normalization and 
other issues


Word Normalization
Putting words/tokens in a standard format
◦U.S.A. or USA
◦uhhuh or uh-huh
◦Fed or fed
◦am, is, be, are 


Case folding
Applications like IR: reduce all letters to lower case
◦Since users tend to use lower case
◦Possible exception: upper case in mid-sentence?
◦e.g., General Motors
◦Fed vs. fed
◦SAIL vs. sail
For sentiment analysis, MT, Information extraction
◦Case is helpful (US versus us is important)


Lemmatization
Represent all words as their lemma, their shared root 
 
= dictionary headword form:
◦am, are, is ® be
◦car, cars, car's, cars' ® car
◦Spanish quiero (‘I want’), quieres (‘you want’) 
® querer ‘want'
◦He is reading detective stories 
® He be read detective story 


Lemmatization is done by Morphological Parsing
Morphemes:
◦The small meaningful units that make up words
◦Stems: The core meaning-bearing units
◦Affixes: Parts that adhere to stems, often with grammatical 
functions
Morphological Parsers:
◦Parse  cats into two morphemes cat and s
◦Parse Spanish amaren (‘if in the future they would love’) into 
morpheme amar ‘to love’, and the morphological features 
3PL and future subjunctive. 


Stemming
Reduce terms to stems, chopping off affixes crudely
This was not the map we 
found in Billy Bones’s 
chest, but an accurate 
copy, complete in all 
things-names and heights 
and soundings-with the 
single exception of the 
red crosses and the 
written notes. 
Thi wa not the map we 
found in Billi Bone s chest 
but an accur copi complet 
in all thing name and 
height and sound with the 
singl except of the red 
cross and the written note 
. 


Porter Stemmer
Based on a series of rewrite rules run in series
◦A cascade, in which output of each pass fed to next pass
Some sample rules:
and soundings-with the single exception of the red crosses
and the written notes.
produces the following stemmed output:
Thi wa not the map we found in Billi Bone s chest but an
accur copi complet in all thing name and height and sound
with the singl except of the red cross and the written note
The algorithm is based on series of rewrite rules run in series, as a cascade, in
ascade
which the output of each pass is fed as input to the next pass; here is a sampling of
the rules:
ATIONAL ! ATE (e.g., relational ! relate)
ING ! ✏
if stem contains vowel (e.g., motoring ! motor)
SSES ! SS
(e.g., grasses ! grass)
Detailed rule lists for the Porter stemmer, as well as code (in Java, Python, etc.)
can be found on Martin Porter’s homepage; see also the original paper (Porter, 1980).
Simple stemmers can be useful in cases where we need to collapse across differ-
ent variants of the same lemma. Nonetheless, they do tend to commit errors of both
over- and under-generalizing, as shown in the table below (Krovetz, 1993):
Errors of Commission
Errors of Omission

European Europe
doing
doe

Dealing with complex morphology is necessary 
for many languages
◦e.g., the Turkish word:
◦Uygarlastiramadiklarimizdanmissinizcasina
◦`(behaving) as if you are among those whom we could not civilize’
◦Uygar `civilized’ + las `become’ 
+ tir `cause’ + ama `not able’ 
+ dik `past’ + lar ‘plural’
+ imiz ‘p1pl’ + dan ‘abl’ 
+ mis ‘past’ + siniz ‘2pl’ + casina ‘as if’ 


Sentence Segmentation
!, ? mostly unambiguous but period “.” is very ambiguous
◦Sentence boundary
◦Abbreviations like Inc. or Dr.
◦Numbers like .02% or 4.3
Common algorithm: Tokenize first: use rules or ML to 
classify a period as either (a) part of the word or (b) a 
sentence-boundary. 
◦An abbreviation dictionary can help
Sentence segmentation can then often be done by rules 
based on this tokenization.

Byte Pair Encoding


Another option for text tokenization
Instead of 
• white-space segmentation
• single-character segmentation 
Use the data to tell us how to tokenize.
Subword tokenization (because tokens can be parts 
of words as well as whole words)


Subword tokenization
Three common algorithms:
◦Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) (Sennrich et al., 2016)
◦Unigram language modeling tokenization (Kudo, 2018)
◦WordPiece (Schuster and Nakajima, 2012)
All have 2 parts:
◦A token learner that takes a raw training corpus and induces 
a vocabulary (a set of tokens). 
◦A token segmenter that takes a raw test sentence and 
tokenizes it according to that vocabulary


Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) token learner
Let vocabulary be the set of all individual characters 
 
= {A, B, C, D,…, a, b, c, d….}
Repeat:
◦Choose the two symbols that are most frequently 
adjacent in the training corpus (say 'A', 'B') 
◦Add a new merged symbol 'AB' to the vocabulary
◦Replace every adjacent 'A' 'B' in the corpus with 'AB'. 
Until k merges have been done.

from the training data, greedily, in the order we learned them. (Thus the frequencies
in the test data don’t play a role, just the frequencies in the training data). So first
we segment each test sentence word into characters. Then we apply the first rule:


Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) Addendum
Most subword algorithms are run inside space-
separated tokens. 
So we commonly first add a special end-of-word 
symbol '__' before space in training corpus
Next, separate into letters.

REGULAR EXPRESSIONS, TEXT NORMALIZATION, EDIT DISTANCE
The algorithm is usually run inside words (not merging across word boundaries),
so the input corpus is first white-space-separated to give a set of strings, each corre-
sponding to the characters of a word, plus a special end-of-word symbol
, and its
counts. Let’s see its operation on the following tiny input corpus of 18 word tokens
with counts for each word (the word low appears 5 times, the word newer 6 times,
and so on), which would have a starting vocabulary of 11 letters:

The BPE algorithm first count all pairs of adjacent symbols: the most frequent
is the pair e r because it occurs in newer (frequency of 6) and wider (frequency of
3) for a total of 9 occurrences1. We then merge these symbols, treating er as one
symbol, and count again:

representation

[IDS] In the context of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) lecture, the image represents a slide discussing the BPE (Byte Pair Encoding) token learner algorithm. The original, very fascinating corpus mentioned refers to the input text that the algorithm processes. The slide explains how BPE works by iteratively replacing the lowest frequency word pair with a new token until no more pairs can be replaced. The resulting vocabulary, listed as an example in the slide, is a set of tokens derived from the corpus through this process. This technique is essential in NLP for creating better word representations and improving models' performance on tasks like language translation and text summarization. [IDE]

frequency of 9.


BPE token segmenter algorithm
On the test data, run each merge learned from the 
training data:
◦Greedily
◦In the order we learned them
◦(test frequencies don't play a role)
So: merge every e r to er, then merge er _ to er_, etc.
Result: 
◦Test set "n e w e r _" would be tokenized as a full word 
◦Test set "l o w e r _" would be two tokens: "low er_"


Properties of BPE tokens
Usually include frequent words

the other tokens we should take into 
account for each token.

a token can not attend to any subsequent 
token. In this example the embedding for 
<s> should not get any information about 
what comes after it.

[IDS] The image is a slide from a lecture on fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), specifically focusing on the concept of "Zero Shot Prompting." The slide explains that this technique involves providing a model with a prompt that isn't part of its training data, and it then performs a task without being explicitly trained on it. An example of this is given in the form of a text response task where the model is asked to respond to a label without having been previously trained on it. This aligns with the topic of fine-tuning LLMs, as it showcases the model's ability to adapt and generate relevant responses without direct training. [IDE]



Zero Shot Prompting
Complex Prompt:
Prompt:
A juggler can juggle 16 balls, half of which are golf 
balls, half of them are green. How many green balls 
does she have?
Response (Llama 2, 70B):
The juggler has 16 balls in total, and half of them are 
green. Therefore, the number of blue balls is 16/2 = 8.
Since half of the balls are golf balls, the number of golf 
balls is also 8.
So, the juggler has 8 green balls and 8 golf balls.

[IDS] The image displays a slide from a lecture on "FineTuning_of_LLMs", which stands for fine-tuning of large language models.

[IDS] In the context of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) lecture, the image represents the concept of fine-tuning pre-trained language models like LLMs (Large Language Models). The slide titled "Zero Shot Train of Thought Prompting" suggests an approach where a juggling analogy is used to explain the process of fine-tuning. This process involves starting with a basic number of balls (green for half and uncolored for half), then adding green balls to reach a desired number (16 balls in this case). The prompt encourages thinking step by step and answering how many golf balls there are after the process. This metaphor likely relates to the incremental updates and adjustments made to LLMs during fine-tuning to improve their performance on specific tasks or domains. [IDE]

Tell the LLM to explain the process step by step1.
Prompt:
A juggler can juggle 16 balls, half of which are 
golf balls, half of them are green. How many 
green balls does she have?
Lets think step by step and answer how many 
golf balls there are. Then answer how many of 
the golf balls are green.
Response (Llama 2, 70B):
Sure, let's break this down step by step!
1) First, we know that the juggler can juggle 16 balls.
2) We also know that half of the balls are golf balls. 
Therefore, the number of golf balls is 16/2 = 8.
3) Now, we know that half of the golf balls are green. 
Therefore, the number of green golf balls is 8/2 = 4.
4) Finally, we add the number of green golf balls to the 
number of green balls that are not golf balls to find 
the total number of green balls. Since we don't know 
how many green balls that are not golf balls, we'll 
just add 4 to the number of green balls that are not 
golf balls.
So, the answer to the question "How many green balls 
does she have?" is 4 + x, where x is the number of 
green balls that are not golf balls.

golf balls, half of them are green. How many 
green balls does she have?
A: 4+x, where x is the number of green balls that 
are not golf balls.

lemonades does she have?
A:
Response (ChatGPT 3.5):
Let's break down the information given:
1. Susan has 12 bottles and cans of soda.
2. Half of them are cans.
So, the number of cans is 12 / 2 = 6.
3. Half of the bottles and cans contain lemonade.
Now, half of the total number of bottles and cans is 12 / 
2 = 6. Since this is also the number of cans, we can 
conclude that all the cans contain lemonade.

The advantages of fine-tuning include potentially higher accuracy, while the disadvantages involve overfitting and the need for a lot of examples. The lecture also emphasizes the importance of catastrophic forgetting and the use of techniques like update or keep frozen to mitigate it. This information is crucial for NLP practitioners who want to leverage the power of pre-trained models for their specific applications without losing the generalization capabilities they have developed during training on diverse datasets.

Low-Rank Assumption:
The update weight matrix ΔW does not contain a lot of 
new information.
This means the rank is lower than the original dimension.

[IDS] In the context of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) lecture, this image represents a concept known as "Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models" or LoRa for short. It's a technique that allows for efficient fine-tuning of large pre-trained language models like BERT or GPT. The slide explains how by assuming low-rank and utilizing the fact that the update weight matrix ΔW is not very large, we can significantly reduce the computational resources needed during the fine-tuning process. This is done by representing ΔW using two smaller matrices: A and B, which are lower in dimensionality than ΔW itself. This method, as shown in the flowchart, can be applied to pre-trained weights to achieve faster and more efficient fine-tuning, which is essential in NLP tasks where fine-tuning large models on specific tasks is often necessary but computationally expensive.

Language models are sequence models
5


Modelling sequences, classic edition: Element by element
Language models are seq2seq  models.
6

[IDS] The image is a slide from a lecture on Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically focusing on the topic of "Retrival_augemented_generation". It illustrates the concept of 'Modelling sequences, classic edition: Element by element', which is likely a method or technique used in NLP for processing and analyzing sequential data. The slide also mentions that language models are models, suggesting a discussion on the nature of language models within this context. The presence of the WXYZ sequence, along with an encoder-decoder architecture diagram, indicates a possible exploration of sequence-to-sequence models in the lecture. [IDE]


Modelling sequences, element by element
Language models are seq2seq  models.
So far this was done element by element, using
Regression on time windowed input, Markov chains,
recurrence e.g. RNNs, or
memory e.g. GRUs. (LSTM 1997)
But this approach cannot easily be parallelized!
6

[IDS] The image is a visual representation of sequence-to-sequence models in NLP, which are used for tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and chatbots. These models consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder processes the input sequence, while the decoder generates the output sequence. The lecture highlights that these models can be difficult to parallelize due to their sequential nature, making them less efficient on parallel hardware like GPUs. [IDE]


Transformers solved this problem...
... by consuming the entire sequence at once as input.
Think about it, there are many sequences that are finished.
We humans just consume it as sequence.
Books, emails, videos, images, webpages, ...
7

[IDS] In this NLP lecture, the focus is on transformer models and their ability to process data in sequence. The slide emphasizes that transformers consume an entire sequence at once as input, which is a characteristic feature of these models. It also highlights that humans tend to think about sequences that are finished, such as books or emails, rather than ongoing processes like videos or webpages. The content suggests a discussion around the nature of sequence processing in natural language understanding and generation tasks. [IDE]


Embedding the tokens
The tokens are each embedded into a numerical domain.
Have a look at the word2vec  paper:
Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space
So the input to the transformer are not vectors, but vectors of vectors.
8

[IDS] In this NLP lecture, we are discussing the concept of embedding tokens into a numerical domain for efficient estimation of word representations in vector space. This process involves converting words into vectors to facilitate better understanding and analysis by machines. The presentation highlights that all transformers are cool, suggesting the importance of transformer models in NLP tasks. It also mentions that the input to the transformer is not vectors but vectors of vectors, indicating the complexity involved in these representations. [IDE]


Calculate the matrix of
pairwise attentions
In a sequence, the elements are
related to each other. (not iid)
For each possible pair of
embedded tokens the
corresponding attention-score is
calculated.
This attention matrix is the heart
of the transformer block .
9

[IDS] The image appears to be a slide from a lecture on Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically discussing the concept of "Retrival_augemented_generation". It explains how to calculate the matrix of pairwise attentions in a sequence. This is a technique used in NLP models, like transformers, to determine the relevance or importance of each element in a sequence relative to other elements. The attention score is calculated for each possible pair of embedded tokens, and this attention matrix is considered the heart of the transformer block in these models. The slide includes visual aids like color-coded squares to help understand the concept of context length and position in relation to the attention mechanism. [IDE]


The transformer block
Consists of two main components:
A filter for what should be
computed.
A classic neural network layer.
This calculation of all attention-
scores can be heavily
parallelized, and that's why
Transformers are so popular!
10

[IDS] The image is a visual representation of the Transformer block, a key component in transformer-based neural networks, particularly in the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The Transformer block is a fundamental part of the Transformer architecture, which has been widely used in various NLP tasks such as machine translation, question answering, and text generation. It consists of two main components: a multi-head attention mechanism and a feed-forward network. These components work together to process input sequences in parallel, allowing the model to capture long-range dependencies between words or tokens. The lecture you are attending is likely discussing how this architecture contributes to advancements in NLP, specifically focusing on retrieval-augmented generation, which combines the strengths of both retrieval-based and generative models for improved performance. [IDE]


Faster training means larger models in the same time
Much larger transformer networks can be trained in the same time as other
seq2seq models.
... and for language models, larger is (one parameter for) better.
See: Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models
11

[IDS] The image depicts a slide from an NLP lecture, specifically discussing the concept of "Faster training means larger models in the same time." It explains that bigger transformer networks can be trained simultaneously with seq2seq models and that for language models, larger is better. The slide includes graphs to illustrate this point, with one graph showing test loss over compute and another graph displaying dataset size vs. parameters. The lecture seems to emphasize the importance of model size in achieving better performance in neural language models. [IDE]


If transformers are so good
What's the problem?
12


Sequence length is the problem
Computing all attention-scores is quadratic in storage and runtime!
(You can battle that by parallelization, but this scales only linear.)
... and then there is also
Multi-Headed Attention
Multiple Transformer blocks in a row.
13


Have a look at the "Chat with your own data" use case
Present your data to the LLM and just chat with it.

However, prompts from this world can quickly become huge.

User prompt: Under what circumstances am I allowed to drill into a listed
building for a fiber optic connection?
Context documents: Attached are all building regulations for Telekom
employees...
... that's a lot of tokens...and it's going to make our attention matrix explode.
14


Academia is looking for ways to extend the context length
15


Some ideas are
State spaces instead of attention:

17


Practitioners use Information Retrieval methods
to reduce context size
18


RAG system
A clever way to reduce the context size of the prompt is to
not use all documents, but rather a selection.
This is known as a Retrieval Augmented Generator.
19

[IDS] In the context of a NLP lecture, the slide presents the RAG system as a method to enhance the context size for document retrieval and generation. It's a clever approach that avoids the limitations of using all documents by selecting a subset, which is then processed through a Retrieval-Augmented Generator. This process likely involves using a coordinator to manage the flow of information between the question, the document database, and the language model (LLM). The LLM would be responsible for generating the final output based on the information retrieved from the database and the input question. The slide number 19 suggests this is part of a larger presentation, and the visual elements help to explain the complex interaction between different components in the RAG system. [IDE]


How to retrieve the documents?
20


Vector search (index documents)
Embed text sequences into a vecor space. E.g. by using:
Token embedder, like BERT, or a headless LLM
Specially trained models, like SentenceBert
21

[IDS] The image you're seeing is a slide from a lecture on Natural Language Processing (NLP). It specifically focuses on the topic of retrieval-augmented generation. The slide outlines the concept of embedding text sequences into a vector space, using token embeddings like BERT or a headless LLM. It also mentions specially trained models such as SentenceBert. These techniques are essential in NLP for tasks like language understanding and generation. [IDE]


Vector search (retrieve similar documents)
Retrieve semantically similar documents by comparing the vectors. (see nice blog post)
Angular/Cosine- or 
-distance
Karpathy's idea of kernel-distance
22

[IDS] The image you're seeing is a visual representation of the concept of vector search in the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It illustrates how vector search algorithms, such as the Sentence Embedding Algorithm shown here, can be used to retrieve semantically similar documents by comparing their vectors. The example given in the image uses the cosine or L1 distance as a measure to determine similarity between the vectors of two documents. The presence of terms like "nice blog post" suggests that the lecture might be discussing practical applications of this technique in retrieving relevant blog posts from a larger corpus of text. This is a fundamental concept in information retrieval and NLP, allowing systems to understand the meaning behind words and retrieve content that is semantically related. [IDE]


The retrieval based approach has many parameters
Which embedding algorithm  to use?
Which similarity measure  to use?
How do you chunk  the documents to get a good embedding?
How to include metadata ?
Process tables  in the document?
How to represent images ?
Do you want to embedd a summary ?
Retrieve surrounding chunks  as well?
Embed the query, or rather a hypothetical answer  to the query
23


You can also just use a keyword related search
Considering the RAG architecture, you don't need a VectorDB.
You just need to find documents fitting a given text query.
Algorithms that come to mind are:
Keyword search
TF-IDF
BM25
24

[IDS] The image is a slide from a lecture on Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically focusing on Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It explains that one can use a keyword-related search rather than the RAG architecture, which is not necessary for VectorDB. The slide emphasizes the need to find documents fitting a given text query using algorithms like keyword search, TF-IDF, and BM25. This concept is essential in NLP as it aids in retrieving relevant information from large datasets by matching keywords or phrases from a query with documents in a database. [IDE]


Hybrid search: Combining search results
Of course you can apply several retrieval strategies and merge search results:
Just use all retrieved documents (not recommended; adds to context size)
Use the top-  documents of each retrieval algorithm
Top-  mean reciprocal re-ranked documents
Top-  documents of a machine-learned ranking
Given feedback, you can mix utilizing multi-armed-bandit theory
25


Dynamic RAG with intermediate queries
Improve on the "ask-once, retrieve once" workflow.
Utilize LLMs with text understanding tasks:
Ask "Are these documents interesting for the following question?"
Ask "Is this an answer to the question?"
Generate sub-queries
You can use frameworks like instructor or autogen to process the LLMs answers.
26


RAG in a corporate environment is special
Data may not be allowed to leave the company
Who is paying for the hardware or the service?
Competing groups building the same thing
Networks inside company
User authentication / robot users
People abusing your service

• + Summarization, question-answering, etc., etc.!!
Why?

[IDS] The image is a snapshot from an NLP (Natural Language Processing) lecture by Dan Jurafsky at Stanford University. The slide is titled "Probabilistic Language Models" and focuses on the concept of assigning a probability to a sentence. It outlines today's goal, which is to assign probabilities to sentences using machine translation as an example. The slide mentions the P(high winds tonight) and P(large winds tonight) as examples of assigning probabilities. Additionally, it introduces spell correction and speech recognition as other topics covered in the lecture. The office hours are mentioned for fifteen minutes, with a note about fifteen-minute meetings. The slide concludes with a reference to summarization, question-answering, etc., indicating these are additional topics or activities related to the lecture. [IDE]


Dan Jurafsky
Probabilistic Language Modeling
• Goal: compute the probability of a sentence or 
sequence of words:
     P(W) = P(w1,w2,w3,w4,w5…wn)
• Related task: probability of an upcoming word:
      P(w5|w1,w2,w3,w4)
• A model that computes either of these:
          P(W)     or     P(wn|w1,w2…wn-1)         is called a language model.
• Better: the grammar       But language model or LM is standard

[IDS] In this NLP lecture, we're discussing Probabilistic Language Modeling. The goal is to compute the probability of a sentence or sequence of words. This involves a related task: predicting an upcoming word given a sequence of previous words. A model that computes either of these is called a language model. It's worth noting that while the grammar model is standard, the language model or LM is considered better. [IDE]


Dan Jurafsky
How to compute P(W)
• How to compute this joint probability:
• P(its, water, is, so, transparent, that)
• Intuition: let’s rely on the Chain Rule of Probability

[IDS] The image is a slide from a lecture on Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically focusing on statistical language models. It explains how to compute the probability P(W) of a sequence of words W in a given context, emphasizing the importance of intuition and understanding the Chain Rule of Probability. The slide serves as a visual aid to help students grasp the concept of joint probabilities and their application in NLP tasks. [IDE]


Dan Jurafsky
Reminder: The Chain Rule
• Recall the definition of conditional probabilities
p(B|A) = P(A,B)/P(A) 
Rewriting:   P(A,B) = P(A)P(B|A)
• More variables:
 P(A,B,C,D) = P(A)P(B|A)P(C|A,B)P(D|A,B,C)
• The Chain Rule in General
  P(x1,x2,x3,…,xn) = P(x1)P(x2|x1)P(x3|x1,x2)…P(xn|x1,…,xn-1)

[IDS] The image displays a slide from an NLP (Natural Language Processing) lecture, specifically discussing statistical language models. It emphasizes the concept of conditional probabilities and their role in defining the Chain Rule, which is a fundamental principle in probability theory and statistics. The slide also highlights the importance of understanding variables and their relationships within the context of language modeling. This topic is crucial for NLP as it helps in predicting the likelihood of words or phrases occurring in a given sequence, which is essential for tasks such as speech recognition, machine translation, and text generation. [IDE]


Dan Jurafsky
The Chain Rule applied to compute 
joint probability of words in sentence
P(“its water is so transparent”) =
 P(its) × P(water|its) ×  P(is|its water) 
         ×  P(so|its water is) ×  P(transparent|its water is so)
  
 
P(w1w2…wn) =
P(wi | w1w2…wi−1)

∏

[IDS] In this NLP lecture, we are discussing the Chain Rule applied to compute joint probabilities of words in a sentence. This is a concept from statistical language models, which are used to predict the likelihood of sequences of words in natural language. The slide illustrates the Chain Rule with an equation that shows how to calculate the probability of a sequence of words (P(w1...wi|wi-1)) by multiplying the individual probabilities of each word given the previous word. [IDE]


Dan Jurafsky
How to estimate these probabilities
• Could we just count and divide?
• No!  Too many possible sentences!
• We’ll never see enough data for estimating these
P(the |its water is so transparent that) =
Count(its water is so transparent that the)
Count(its water is so transparent that)

[IDS] In the context of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) lecture, the image represents a slide that discusses the challenges and limitations of estimating probabilities in statistical language models. The slide is likely part of a presentation by Dan Jurafsky from Stanford University's NLP program, emphasizing the difficulty in counting and dividing to estimate probabilities when dealing with data such as water, which is considered transparent and abundant. This illustrates the complexity of modeling language patterns and the need for innovative methods to overcome these challenges in NLP. [IDE]


Dan Jurafsky
Markov Assumption
• Simplifying assumption:
• Or maybe
P(the |its water is so transparent that) ≈P(the |that)
P(the |its water is so transparent that) ≈P(the |transparent that)
Andrei Markov

[IDS] The image displays a slide from an NLP lecture, specifically focusing on the Markov Assumption. This assumption is crucial in statistical language models, which are used to predict the likelihood of sequences of words or characters in natural language. The slide simplifies the concept by suggesting that the probability of a sequence of words (P(the lit water is so transparent that)) is equal to the product of individual probabilities (P(the | that) * P(transparent | that)). This is a common approach in Markov models, where the future state is determined by the current state, and it's applied to NLP tasks like text generation and speech recognition. [IDE]


Dan Jurafsky
Markov Assumption
• In other words, we approximate each 
component in the product
  
P(w1w2…wn) ≈
P(wi | wi−k…wi−1)
i
∏
  
P(wi | w1w2…wi−1) ≈P(wi | wi−k…wi−1)

[IDS] In the context of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) lecture, this image represents a concept known as Markov Assumption. It illustrates how in NLP models, we often approximate the probability of a sequence of words by considering the probability of each word given its immediate predecessor, ignoring the rest of the context. This is a simplification that allows us to work with large amounts of data and complex language patterns. The equation shown is a key component of many statistical language models used in NLP to predict the next word in a sentence or sequence. [IDE]

The slide provides a formula for the probability of a sentence using the unigram model and includes an example sentence with its corresponding probability calculation. The context of the lecture is to educate students about how these models work and their application in natural language processing tasks. [IDE]

This model helps NLP systems to make more informed decisions when processing and generating human language. [IDE]


Dan Jurafsky
N-gram models
• We can extend to trigrams, 4-grams, 5-grams
• In general this is an insufficient model of language
• because language has long-distance dependencies:
“The computer which I had just put into the machine room on 
the fifth floor crashed.”
• But we can often get away with N-gram models

[IDS] In the image, we see a slide from a lecture on NLP (Natural Language Processing) that specifically focuses on statistical language models. The slide is titled "N-gram models" and discusses the limitations of these models when extended to longer sequences of words. It mentions the issue of long-distance dependencies and how they can cause computational problems, such as a computer crashing. The slide also suggests that these problems can be mitigated by using N-gram models. This information is presented in bullet points for clarity and emphasis. [IDE]

They are fundamental in understanding how language is structured and can be used for tasks such as language translation, speech recognition, and text generation. The image serves as an introduction to the topic, using a word cloud to visually represent the complexity and diversity of concepts within the field of language modeling. [IDE]

Estimating bigram probabilities
• The Maximum Likelihood Estimate
€ 
P(wi | wi−1) = count(wi−1,wi)
count(wi−1)
P(wi | wi−1) = c(wi−1,wi)
c(wi−1)

[IDS] In this NLP lecture, we are discussing the concept of "Estimating bigram probabilities" which is a fundamental aspect of statistical language models. These models use probability distributions to predict the likelihood of sequences of words in natural language. The slide presents the maximum likelihood estimate formula for calculating bigram probabilities, which is a key technique used in language modeling to determine how likely it is to see a sequence of words in a given context. [IDE]

An example
<s> I am Sam </s>
<s> Sam I am </s>
<s> I do not like green eggs and ham </s>
P(wi | wi−1) = c(wi−1,wi)
c(wi−1)

[IDS] The image displays an example from a Natural Language Processing (NLP) lecture, specifically related to the topic of Statistical language models. It illustrates how probabilities are calculated in such models, using the context of a person named Sam and their statements about green eggs and ham. The equations provided show how the probability of a sequence of words is determined based on the individual probabilities of each word within that sequence, which is a fundamental concept in NLP for understanding and generating human-like language.

[IDS] The image is a slide from an NLP lecture, discussing examples of Berkeley Restaurant Project sentences. These sentences are used to illustrate the topic of statistical language models in NLP. The examples include various questions and statements about food preferences and availability at restaurants, such as asking for recommendations on good Cantonese restaurants close by, inquiring about mid-priced Thai food options, and seeking information on places to eat breakfast or have coffee in Venice. These sentences serve as practical examples of how statistical language models can be applied in real-world scenarios, particularly in understanding user queries and providing relevant responses.

Raw bigram counts
• Out of 9222 sentences

[IDS] The image displays a table representing the raw bigram counts in the context of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) lecture on Statistical language models. It illustrates how to calculate the probability of a sentence using bigrams, which are pairs of adjacent words in a sequence. This is a fundamental concept in NLP for modeling the structure of language and predicting the next word in a sentence based on the previous one. The table shows the number of times each bigram appears in a given set of sentences, emphasizing the importance of frequency in statistical language modeling. [IDE]

Result:

[IDS] In the context of an NLP lecture, the image represents a practical demonstration of statistical language models. It illustrates the concept of probability normalization and how it is applied to predict the likelihood of different words appearing in a sequence. The table shows the raw probabilities for various words such as "i", "want", "to", "eat", "chinese", "food", "lunch", and "spend". These probabilities are then normalized to ensure they sum up to 1, reflecting the model's confidence in each word given the context. This process is crucial for understanding the context in which words are used and for making accurate predictions about what might come next in a text. As we delve deeper into NLP, these statistical models form the foundation for tasks like language translation, sentiment analysis, and text generation. [IDE]

[IDS] In the context of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) lecture, the image represents a fundamental concept in statistical language modeling. The slide is titled "Bigram estimates of sentence probabilities," indicating that it discusses how to estimate the probability of a sequence of two words in a sentence, also known as bigrams. The equation P(<s> I want english food <s>) = P(I|<s>) x P(want|I) x P(english|want) x P(food|english) x P(<s>/|food) =.000031 illustrates how these probabilities are calculated and combined to determine the overall probability of a given sentence. This is a crucial aspect of understanding how computers can predict the next word in a sentence or evaluate the likelihood of a sentence being part of a certain language or text corpus. [IDE]

Language 
Modeling
Evaluation and Perplexity


How to evaluate N-gram models
"Extrinsic (in-vivo) Evaluation"
To compare models A and B
1. Put each model in a real task
• Machine Translation, speech recognition, etc. 
2. Run the task, get a score for A and for B
• How many words translated correctly
• How many words transcribed correctly
3. Compare accuracy for A and B


Intrinsic (in-vitro) evaluation 
Extrinsic evaluation not always possible
• Expensive, time-consuming 
• Doesn't always generalize to other applications
Intrinsic evaluation: perplexity
• Directly measures language model performance at 
predicting words.
• Doesn't necessarily correspond with real application 
performance
• But gives us a single general metric for language models
• Useful for large language models (LLMs) as well as n-grams


Training sets and test sets
We train parameters of our model on a training set.
We test the model’s performance on data we 
haven’t seen.
◦A test set is an unseen dataset; different from training set.
◦Intuition: we want to measure generalization to unseen data
◦An evaluation metric (like perplexity) tells us how well 
our model does on the test set.


Choosing training and test sets
• If we're building an LM for a specific task
• The test set should reflect the task language we 
want to use the model for
• If we're building a general-purpose model
• We'll need lots of different kinds of training 
data
• We don't want the training set or the test set to 
be just from one domain or author or language.


Training on the test set
We can’t allow test sentences into the training set
• Or else the LM will assign that sentence an artificially 
high probability when we see it in the test set
• And hence assign the whole test set a falsely high 
probability.
• Making the LM look better than it really is
This is called “Training on the test set”
Bad science! 
33


Dev sets
•If we test on the test set many times we might 
implicitly tune to its characteristics
•Noticing which changes make the model better. 
•So we run on the test set only once, or a few times
•That means we need a third dataset: 
• A development test set or, devset. 
• We test our LM on the devset until the very end
• And then test our LM on the test set once


Intuition of perplexity as evaluation metric: 
How good is our language model?
Intuition: A good LM prefers "real" sentences
•
Assign higher probability to “real” or “frequently 
observed” sentences 
•
Assigns lower probability to “word salad” or 
“rarely observed” sentences?


Intuition of perplexity 2: 
Predicting upcoming words
The Shannon Game: How well can we 
predict the next word?
•  Once upon a ____
•  That is a picture of a  ____
•  For breakfast I ate my usual ____

Claude Shannon
A good LM is one that assigns a higher probability 
to the next word that actually occurs

[IDS] The image is a slide from a lecture on statistical language models, specifically focusing on the Shannon Game. It demonstrates the concept of perplexity, which measures how well a model predicts the next word in a sequence. The slide features a picture of Claude Shannon and includes a text-based example of the game, along with a graph that illustrates the perplexity values over time. This visual aid helps students understand how a higher likelihood (lower perplexity) correlates with a better prediction of upcoming words in a text. [IDE]


Intuition of perplexity 3: The best language model 
is one that best predicts the entire unseen test set
• We said: a good LM is one that assigns a higher 
probability to the next word that actually occurs. 
• Let's generalize to all the words!
• The best LM assigns high probability to the entire test 
set.
• When comparing two LMs, A and B
• We compute PA(test set) and PB(test set)
• The better LM will give a higher probability to (=be less 
surprised by) the test set than the other LM.


• Probability depends on size of test set
• Probability gets smaller the longer the text
• Better: a metric that is per-word, normalized by length
• Perplexity is the inverse probability of the test set, 
normalized by the number of words
Intuition of perplexity 4: Use perplexity instead of 
raw probability
PP(W)
=
P(w1w2...wN )
−1
N
           
=
1
P(w1w2...wN )
N


Perplexity is the inverse probability of the test set, 
normalized by the number of words
(The inverse comes from the original definition of perplexity 
from cross-entropy rate in information theory)
Probability range is  [0,1], perplexity range is [1,∞]
Minimizing perplexity is the same as maximizing probability
Intuition of perplexity 5: the inverse

Bigrams:
Chain rule:

[IDS] The image is a visual aid for a lecture on "Statistical language models," specifically focusing on the concept of perplexity and N-grams. Perplexity is a measure of how well a statistical model predicts a sample. A lower perplexity score indicates that the model has a better fit to the data. In this context, N-grams are sequences of n items from a given sample of text or speech. The slide provides a mathematical formula for calculating PP(W) in terms of P(w1w2...wn), which represents the probability of a sequence of words. This formula is a part of the larger equation for PP(W), which involves summing over all possible sequences of words up to length N, and then dividing by the number of such sequences. The slide also introduces the chain rule and Bigrams, which are special cases of N-grams where n=2. Understanding these concepts is crucial for developing effective language models that can predict the next word in a sentence based on the context provided by previous words. [IDE]


Intuition of perplexity 7: 
Weighted average branching factor
Perplexity is also the weighted average branching factor of a language. 
Branching factor: number of possible next words that can follow any word
Example: Deterministic language L = {red,blue, green} 
 
Branching factor = 3 (any word can be followed by red, blue, green)
Now assume LM A where each word follows any other word with equal probability ⅓
Given a test set T = "red red red red blue"
PerplexityA(T) = PA(red red red red blue)-1/5 = 
But now suppose red was very likely in training set, such that for LM B:
◦
P(red) = .8   p(green) = .1  p(blue) = .1
We would expect the probability to be higher, and hence the perplexity to be smaller:
PerplexityB(T) = PB(red red red red blue)-1/5 
((⅓)5)-1/5 = (⅓)-1
=3
= (.8 * .8 * .8 * .8 * .1) -1/5
=.04096 -1/5
= .527-1
= 1.89


Holding test set constant:
Lower perplexity = better language model

Claude Shannon

[IDS] The image you're seeing is likely a slide from a lecture on NLP (Natural Language Processing), specifically focusing on statistical language models. It discusses two methods: the Shannon (1948) Visualization Method and the Bigram method, both used to represent and analyze the probability of word sequences in text. The slide features a quote from Claude Shannon, emphasizing the importance of representing and analyzing natural language effectively, which is crucial for understanding how language works and for developing advanced NLP applications. [IDE]


How Shannon sampled those words in 1948
"Open a book at random and select a letter at random on the page. 
This letter is recorded. The book is then opened to another page 
and one reads until this letter is encountered. The succeeding 
letter is then recorded. Turning to another page this second letter 
is searched for and the succeeding letter recorded, etc."

[IDS] The image you're viewing is a visual representation of the process described in the text, which is related to statistical language models. These models are used in natural language processing (NLP) to predict the next word in a sequence based on statistical patterns learned from a large corpus of text data. The book in the image symbolizes the vast amount of data that such models are trained on, while the open pages represent the randomness and variability of language. The act of selecting a letter at random and recording it in the book illustrates how statistical language models learn by observing and predicting the frequency and co-occurrence of words in texts. This process helps the model to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, which is essential for tasks like language translation, speech recognition, and text completion. [IDE]

[IDS] The image is a visual representation of a concept in statistical language models, specifically illustrating the process of sampling from a distribution. It demonstrates how words are sampled with probabilities proportional to their frequency in a text corpus. The polyphonic however, with a probability of.0003, is sampled as an example. This image helps learners understand how language models predict the likelihood of a word occurring in a sequence by assigning probabilities based on the frequency of word co-occurrence in large datasets. The slide serves as a practical explanation of the theoretical concepts taught in NLP lectures, making it easier for students to grasp the underlying principles of statistical language modeling. [IDE]


Visualizing Bigrams the Shannon Way
Choose a random bigram (<s>, w) 
         according to its probability p(w|<s>)
Now choose a random bigram        (w, x) 
according to its probability p(x|w)
And so on until we choose </s>
Then string the words together
<s> I
    I want
      want to
           to eat
              eat Chinese
                  Chinese food
                          food </s>
I want to eat Chinese food


Note: there are other sampling methods
Used for neural language models
Many of them avoid generating words from the very 
unlikely tail of the distribution
We'll discuss when we get to neural LM decoding:
◦Temperature sampling
◦Top-k sampling
◦Top-p sampling

If task-specific, use a training corpus that has a similar 
genre to your task.

Make sure to cover different kinds of dialects and 
speaker/authors.

• Can include the auxiliary verb finna that marks immediate future tense:
• "My phone finna die"

Language 
Modeling

[IDS] The image is a visual representation of the concept of "Language Modeling" in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It emphasizes the importance of statistical language models in understanding and generating human language. The word cloud serves as a metaphor for the complexity and interconnectedness of words and their meanings within language. The term "Smoothing: Add-one (Laplace) smoothing" suggests that the lecture might cover techniques to improve the performance of language models by adding a small amount of probability mass to all events, which is a common method in statistical language modeling to handle the problem of unseen data. [IDE]

[IDS] In this NLP lecture, we are discussing the concept of "The intuition of smoothing" from Dan Klein. The slide explains how sparse statistics can be handled when working with language models. It introduces the concept of P(w | denied the) and mentions various statistics such as 3 allegations, 2 reports, 1 claim, 1 request, and a total count of 7. The slide also discusses the idea of stealing probability mass to generalize better, showing a probability distribution with different outcomes like allegations, claims, requests, and outcomes such as attack, man, and outcome. This is likely part of a larger discussion on how to improve the performance and robustness of statistical language models by considering the context and rarity of certain events or words in the data. [IDE]

Add-one estimation
• Also called Laplace smoothing
• Pretend we saw each word one more time than we did
• Just add one to all the counts!
• MLE estimate:
• Add-1 estimate:
P
MLE(wi | wi−1) = c(wi−1,wi)
c(wi−1)

[IDS] In the context of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) lecture, the image likely represents a slide discussing techniques for improving language models. The "Add-one estimation" method is a technique used to smooth the Laplace smoothing in NLP models. It's a way to prevent overfitting by adding a small value to the counts of each word in a document, which helps to deal with rare words or out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. The formula shown calculates the probability of a word given its context in the model, taking into account the added value. This is an important concept in statistical language models as it improves the model's ability to predict the likelihood of a word appearing in a given context. [IDE]

Maximum Likelihood Estimates
•
The maximum likelihood estimate
• of some parameter of a model M from a training set T
• maximizes the likelihood of the training set T given the model M
•
Suppose the word “bagel” occurs 400 times in a corpus of a million words
•
What is the probability that a random word from some other text will be 
“bagel”?
•
MLE estimate is 400/1,000,000 = .0004
•
This may be a bad estimate for some other corpus
• But it is the estimate that makes it most likely that “bagel” will occur 400 times in 
a million word corpus.

[IDS] In the image, we see a slide from a lecture on Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically discussing statistical language models. The slide is titled "Maximum Likelihood Estimates" and explains the concept of likelihood estimation in NLP.

The slide also provides an example of a bad estimate for some other corpus and defines it as the estimate that makes it most likely that a "bagel" will occur 400 times in a million word corpus. This is likely part of a larger discussion on how these estimates are used to improve language understanding and generation in NLP applications. [IDE]

Backoff and Interpolation
• Sometimes it helps to use less context
• Condition on less context for contexts you haven’t learned much about 
• Backoff: 
• use trigram if you have good evidence,
• otherwise bigram, otherwise unigram
• Interpolation: 
• mix unigram, bigram, trigram
• Interpolation works better

Additionally, interpolation is discussed as a technique that mixes different n-grams to improve the model's performance. [IDE]


Dan Jurafsky
Linear Interpolation
• Simple interpolation
• Lambdas conditional on context:
from all the N-gram estimators, weighing and combining the trigram, bigram, and
unigram counts.
In simple linear interpolation, we combine different order N-grams by linearly
interpolating all the models. Thus, we estimate the trigram probability P(wn|wn−2wn−1)
by mixing together the unigram, bigram, and trigram probabilities, each weighted
by a l:
ˆ
P(wn|wn−2wn−1) = l1P(wn|wn−2wn−1)
+l2P(wn|wn−1)
+l3P(wn)
(4.24)
such that the ls sum to 1:
X
i
li = 1
(4.25)
In a slightly more sophisticated version of linear interpolation, each l weight is
computed in a more sophisticated way, by conditioning on the context. This way,
if we have particularly accurate counts for a particular bigram, we assume that the
counts of the trigrams based on this bigram will be more trustworthy, so we can
make the ls for those trigrams higher and thus give that trigram more weight in

[IDS] The image is a slide from a lecture on Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically focusing on statistical language models. It introduces the concept of linear interpolation, which is a method used to combine multiple language models into one more accurate model. The slide explains that in linear interpolation, multiple models are weighted and summed together to produce a final output probability. The lambda values (λ) represent the weights for each model, and the sum of these weights is equal to 1, ensuring that the combined model's probabilities add up to 1 as well. The context of this topic is further elaborated by mentioning that lambdas can be conditioned on certain factors, such as previous words in a sequence, which is a crucial aspect of NLP when dealing with language modeling. [IDE]


Dan Jurafsky
How to set the lambdas?
• Use a held-out corpus
• Choose λs to maximize the probability of held-out data:
• Fix the N-gram probabilities (on the training data)
• Then search for λs that give largest probability to held-out set:
Training Data

Unknown words: Open versus closed 
vocabulary tasks
•
If we know all the words in advanced
• Vocabulary V is fixed
• Closed vocabulary task
•
Often we don’t know this
• Out Of Vocabulary = OOV words
• Open vocabulary task
•
Instead: create an unknown word token <UNK>
• Training of <UNK> probabilities
• Create a fixed lexicon L of size V
• At text normalization phase, any training word not in L changed to  <UNK>
• Now we train its probabilities like a normal word
• At decoding time
• If text input: Use UNK probabilities for any word not in training

[IDS] The image is a slide from a lecture on NLP (Natural Language Processing) focusing on statistical language models. It discusses the concept of "unknown words" and their handling in such models, particularly when vocabulary is either fixed or open. The slide suggests that in advanced language processing tasks like closed vocabulary tasks or tasks with a large number of unknown words (OOV), it's crucial to address the issue of OOV words. The slide provides strategies for dealing with these OOV words, such as creating a lexicon of sizes LV, training a fixed lexical size model at text normalization phase, and training the model with its probabilities like a normal word. Additionally, it mentions the use of decoding time and inputting UNK probabilities for any word not in training. [IDE]

------------Static_embedding_word2Vec------------

What have we seen so far?
1) One Hot Encoding: 
●Representation of words as binary vectors
●Sparse
●Lack of semantic information
●Size: |V|
2) TFIDF Embedding
●Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
●Reflects importance of word in document relative 
to document collection
●Weighs down frequent terms, scales up rare ones
●Still lacks contextual understanding
●Size: |D| (number of documents)

[IDS] The image is a slide from a lecture on Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically discussing the topic of "Static_embedding_word2Vec". It highlights various aspects of Word2Vec, such as one-hot encoding, which uses binary vectors to represent words. It also mentions the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) embedding, reflecting the importance of words in documents and their relative frequency. The slide notes that Word2Vec still lacks contextual understanding and discusses the size of the embedding, mentioning that it's measured in terms of the number of documents. This information suggests that the lecture is focused on understanding how word embeddings, like those created by Word2Vec, can be used to represent words in a way that captures their semantic meaning within a given context. [IDE]



Recap: Similarity and Relatedness
●Similarity: Likeliness between two words in 
meaning or context. (Can I replace the word in the 
sentence with the other word?)
●Relatedness: How strongly are two words 
associated. (Are the two words likely to appear 
together?)

[IDS] The image is a slide from a lecture on Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically focusing on word embeddings using the Word2Vec model. It highlights the concept of "Static_embedding_word2Vec," which refers to the process of creating fixed representations of words in a vector space, where semantically similar words are close to each other. The slide emphasizes the importance of similarity and relatedness in understanding how these word embeddings capture the meaning and context of words. It also mentions that the strength of association between two words can be determined by their proximity in this vector space, with closely associated words appearing together. This concept is fundamental in NLP tasks such as text classification, machine translation, and language modeling. [IDE]



Recap: Similarity and Relatedness
●Similarity: Likeliness between two words in 
meaning or context. (Can I replace the word in the 
sentence with the other word?)
●Relatedness: How strongly are two words 
associated. (Are the two words likely to appear 
together?)
”I like to eat pizza. I like to eat stew” 
→ pizza and stew are similar in this context
”Pizza is baked”
→  pizza and baked are related since they often 
appear together
There is no clear distinction between these two!

[IDS] The image is a slide from a lecture on Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically focusing on the topic of "Static_embedding_word2Vec." This slide aims to explain the concept of similarity and relatedness in the context of word embeddings, which are a method for representing words as vectors in a high-dimensional space. The slide emphasizes the importance of understanding how closely related two words are by discussing likeliness and relatedness. It uses examples like "pizza" and "stew" to illustrate that although these words are associated, they are not strongly related, whereas words like "pizza" and "baked" are more strongly related since they often appear together. This is likely part of a larger discussion on how word embeddings can be used to capture semantic relationships between words, which is a fundamental aspect of NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. [IDE]



Distributional Structure of Language
Consider the following sentence:
Berlin is the capital of Germany.
What does this tell us about Berlin?
Obvious: Berlin is the capital of Germany.

[IDS] The image displays a slide from a lecture on Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically focusing on the topic of word embeddings. The title "Static_embedding_word2Vec" suggests that the lecture is discussing static word embeddings, which are a type of representation for words in a vector space, and it mentions Word2Vec as a particular algorithm used to create these embeddings. The bullet points provide further context, stating that Berlin is the capital of Germany and asking the audience to consider what this tells us about Berlin, with the answer being that Berlin is also the capital of Germany. This seems to be an example or exercise related to understanding the context and semantic relationships between words in NLP. [IDE]



Distributional Structure of Language
Consider the following sentence:
Walala is the capital of Lampukistan.
What does this tell us about Walala?

[IDS] The image appears to be a slide from a lecture on Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically focusing on the topic of word embeddings using the Word2Vec algorithm. The title "Distributional Structure of Language" suggests that the lecture is discussing how words in a language are used together, which is a foundational concept in understanding how word embeddings work. [IDE]



Distributional Structure of Language
Consider the following sentence:
Walala is the capital of Lampukistan.
What does this tell us about Walala?
→ Walala is similar to words that appear in the
    context of “is the capital of”.
→ Walala is a city.

[IDS] In the context of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) lecture, the image is likely discussing the topic of "Static_embedding_word2Vec," which refers to a method for converting words into fixed-length vectors in a high-dimensional space. These vectors capture semantic relationships between words and can be used for various NLP tasks such as text classification, clustering, or language translation. The slide might be introducing this concept, explaining how word embeddings work, or discussing their applications in NLP. [IDE]



Distributional Structure of Language
Words that appear in a similar context are similar.
How do we learn embeddings that capture these 
semantic relationships?

[IDS] The image is a slide from a lecture on Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically focusing on the topic of "Static_embedding_word2Vec". The title of the slide is "Distributional Structure of Language", which suggests that the lecture might be discussing how words appear in similar contexts and how we can learn embeddings that capture these semantic relationships. The slide also includes logos and names of institutions or individuals, such as Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg, Fachbereich Informatik, and Tim Metzler, indicating their involvement in the lecture or the course. [IDE]



Distributional Structure of Language
Words that appear in a similar context are similar.
How do we learn embeddings that capture these 
semantic relationships?
Requirements:
●Fixed vector size
●Similar words should have similar representations in 
the vector space
●General vectors, not optimized for a specific domain
●Easy to learn
●Can learn from vast amounts of data (e.g. Wikipedia, 
Common Crawl, etc)

[IDS] In this NLP lecture, we are exploring the concept of static embeddings using Word2Vec. This involves learning vector representations for words that capture their semantic relationships in a similar context. The requirements for such a model include fixed vector size and similar representations in the vector space for semantically similar words. General vectors should not be optimized for a specific domain, making it easy to learn and transferable across different domains like Wikipedia, Common Crawl, or others. [IDE]



Distributional Structure of Language
We need a learning task that will produce these 
vectors.
Idea: Train a simple classifier to predict word from 
context or predict context from word.

[IDS] The image you're seeing is likely a slide from a Natural Language Processing (NLP) lecture, specifically focusing on the topic of word embeddings using the Word2Vec algorithm. The title "Distributional Structure of Language" suggests that the lecture will discuss how language can be represented in a mathematical form based on its distributional properties. The main idea presented is the need for a learning task that produces vectors to capture the semantic relationships between words. To achieve this, the lecture proposes training a simple classifier to predict a word from its context or predict the context from a word, which is essentially what Word2Vec does. The institutions mentioned at the bottom, Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg and Fachbereich Informatik, indicate that the lecture might be part of a course offered by these institutions. The name Tim Metzler could be the instructor or author of the lecture material. [IDE]

Idea: Train a simple classifier to predict word from 
context or predict context from word.

[IDS] The image displays a slide from a Natural Language Processing (NLP) lecture that focuses on the topic of static embeddings using the Word2Vec algorithm. The slide introduces the concept of "Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space" developed by Mikolov et al., as presented in their 2013 paper published in Google. It highlights the significance of distributed representations of words and phrases, which are advanced in neural information processing systems. The slide also emphasizes the idea of training a simple classifier to predict word context or context from word, which is an essential aspect of understanding how Word2Vec works in NLP tasks. [IDE]



Word2Vec
Example Sentence:

[IDS] The image displays a slide from a lecture on Word2Vec, a popular technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for learning vector representations of words. The slide presents an example sentence to illustrate the concept of static embedding in Word2Vec. Static embedding refers to the process of mapping each word in a vocabulary to a fixed-length vector, which captures its semantic and syntactic properties. In this case, the example sentence is "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." This sentence is often used as a test phrase in NLP tasks because it contains all the letters of the English alphabet. By analyzing such sentences, researchers can evaluate how well Word2Vec captures the meaning of individual words and their relationships with one another. [IDE]



Word2Vec
Example Sentence:

[IDS] The image is a visual representation of how Word2Vec, a popular technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP), embeds words into vectors. It illustrates the concept of static embeddings, which are fixed-length vectors that represent words in a high-dimensional space. In this context, each word is assigned a unique vector, and words with similar meanings or usage patterns are placed closer together in this space. The example sentence provided is "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog," which is used to demonstrate how words can be mapped to their corresponding vectors in a 2-dimensional space. This visualization helps NLP practitioners understand how Word2Vec captures semantic relationships between words by positioning them in proximity based on their semantic similarities. [IDE]



Word2Vec
Continuous Bag-Of-Word Model
Predict center word from context

[IDS] The image depicts a Word2Vec model, which is a technique for creating word embeddings in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It's designed to map words into a vector space where semantically similar words are closer together. In this visualization, we see the continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) architecture of Word2Vec, where the goal is to predict the target word based on its context. The input layer consists of a classifier that processes the context words and predicts the target word. This model is commonly used in NLP tasks like language translation, sentiment analysis, and text generation. [IDE]



Word2Vec
Skip Gram Model
Predict context from center word.
We will use this approach for our 
examples!

[IDS] The image is a visual representation of Word2Vec, a popular technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that maps words to vectors of real numbers. In this context, we are discussing the Skip Gram Model, which is a method used by Word2Vec to learn vector representations of words. The model predicts the context words surrounding a target word, and these predictions are used to train a classifier. The classifier then learns to associate certain properties with words, such as 'brown' being associated with 'dog', 'fox', and 'jumps'. This approach allows for the creation of word embeddings, which are dense vectors that capture semantic relationships between words. The lecture likely covers how these embeddings can be utilized in various NLP tasks, such as text classification or language translation. [IDE]

Word2Vec - Negative Sampling Skip Gram Model

[IDS] The image is a diagram of the Word2Vec model, which is a popular technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for creating word embeddings. In this context, we are discussing static embeddings, meaning that the embeddings are not updated during training and remain fixed. The diagram shows two main components: the input layer and the output layer. The input layer takes in words as vectors, represented by circles with the word and its corresponding index. These words are then processed through a window of size 1, indicating that only one word at a time is being considered. This processed word is then passed through a dot product operation to produce an output vector. The output layer shows two dimensions, W1 and W2, which represent the learned weight matrices for the skip-gram model, a type of Word2Vec architecture that predicts the surrounding words given a target word. The entire process is depicted in a simple flowchart format, typical of NLP lectures to help students understand how word embeddings are created using the Word2Vec algorithm. [IDE]

[IDS] The image depicts a visualization of the Word2Vec model's Negative Sampling Skip Gram Model, which is a concept in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This model is used to learn word embeddings by predicting whether two words co-occur in a given context. The diagram illustrates the architecture of this model with input layers for words and their context, as well as output layers that determine if the predicted word and the target word are likely to appear together in a sentence. The lecture titled "Static_embedding_word2Vec" likely covers the basics of this model and its applications in NLP tasks such as language translation and text classification. [IDE]



Word2Vec - Negative Sampling Skip Gram Model
Previous approach vs this approach:
Time for one forward pass in a notebook:
Previous: 
~150 ms for vocabulary size of 1,000,000!
This approach:
~30 µs for vocabulary size of 1,000,000!
~5000 times faster!

[IDS] The image displays a comparison between two approaches to word embeddings, specifically focusing on the Word2Vec model. The first approach is the traditional method which involves one forward pass in a notebook and takes approximately 150 milliseconds for a vocabulary size of 1,000,000. The second approach, referred to as "Negative Sampling Skip Gram Model," significantly reduces the time required, taking around 30 microseconds for the same vocabulary size. This suggests that the Negative Sampling Skip Gram Model is much faster, reducing the time by about 5000 times compared to the traditional method. As we are in an NLP lecture, this information is particularly relevant as it highlights advancements in natural language processing techniques and the importance of efficient computational methods in handling large datasets. [IDE]



Word2Vec - Negative Sampling Skip Gram Model
This is not the full truth!
So far we have only created positive examples where:
(word1, word2) → 1
Without negative examples our classifier could always predict 1 
and achieve a 100% accuracy.

[IDS] The image displays a slide from an NLP lecture, specifically focusing on the Word2Vec algorithm and its application in creating negative sampling skip gram models. The content suggests that the current model is not complete as it only contains positive examples (word1, word2) without any negative examples. This lack of negative examples hinders the model's ability to predict accurately, as evidenced by the claim that even with 100% accuracy on positive examples, the classifier would still predict 1 without considering negative examples. The slide seems to be emphasizing the importance of including negative examples in the training data to improve the performance of the Word2Vec model. [IDE]

enough.

[IDS] The image is a slide from an NLP lecture, specifically focusing on the Word2Vec model and its application in creating negative examples for training. The title "Word2Vec - Negative Sampling Skip Gram Model" suggests that the slide is discussing a method for generating negative examples using Word2Vec, which is a word embedding algorithm used to convert words or phrases into vectors of real numbers that capture their semantic meaning. The content of the slide indicates that the audience is being asked to think about how they would create negative examples, with a specific example given (IV - 1 negative examples) and a statement suggesting that experiments show a range of negative examples per positive example are necessary. This implies that understanding the concept of negative sampling is crucial for fine-tuning the performance of the Word2Vec model. [IDE]

Re: "exact" synonyms

[IDS] In the context of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) lecture, the image serves as an illustration of how language can be represented and analyzed. The text from the 1718 book by Abbé Gabriel Girard is an example of the early stages of linguistic research, focusing on the precise meanings of words in different languages. This historical perspective is crucial for understanding how NLP has evolved over time. In modern NLP, techniques like static embedding and vector semantics play a significant role in capturing the essence of words and their relationships within a language. These methods involve representing words as vectors in a high-dimensional space where semantically similar words are closer together. This enables NLP systems to understand word meanings and use them effectively in tasks such as language translation, sentiment analysis, and text generation. The image of the old book serves as a reminder of the rich history and foundational work that has led to the development of these advanced NLP techniques. [IDE]

[IDS] The image you provided is related to a lecture on Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically focusing on the topic of "Static_embedding_Vector_semeantic_embeddings." The text in the image seems to be discussing a concept or term from this field. NLP is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. In the context of static embeddings, it refers to a technique where words or phrases are represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space, capturing their semantic meaning.

The term "Vector" in this context likely refers to mathematical vectors used to represent words or phrases in a way that captures their meaning and relationships. These vectors can be used for tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.

The image itself serves as a visual representation of the concept being discussed in the lecture. It's a photograph of a bunch of green leaves, which could symbolize growth, nature, or freshness – concepts often associated with NLP's goal of understanding and generating human language in a meaningful way.

As a helpful assistant, I would explain that static embeddings are an essential part of NLP because they allow machines to understand the meaning behind words and phrases by mapping them to numerical vectors. This process enables various NLP tasks, including text classification, where the machine can determine the category of a piece of text based on its content.

In summary, the image is a visual aid for a lecture on NLP, specifically discussing static embeddings and vector-based semantic embeddings. These concepts are crucial for teaching machines to understand and interpret human language effectively. [IDE]

We define meaning of a word as a vector
Called an "embedding" because it's embedded into a 
space (see textbook)
The standard way to represent meaning in NLP
Every modern NLP algorithm uses embeddings as 
the representation of word meaning
Fine-grained model of meaning for similarity 


Intuition: why vectors?
Consider sentiment analysis:
◦With words,  a feature is a word identity
◦Feature 5: 'The previous word was "terrible"'
◦requires exact same word to be in training and test
◦With embeddings: 
◦Feature is a word vector
◦'The previous word was vector [35,22,17…]
◦Now in the test set we might see a similar vector [34,21,14]


We'll discuss 2 kinds of embeddings
tf-idf
◦Information Retrieval workhorse!
◦A common baseline model
◦Sparse vectors
◦Words are represented by (a simple function of) the counts of nearby 
words

[IDS] The image is likely a slide from a lecture on Natural Language Processing (NLP). It discusses the transition from computing with meaning representations to using string representations, emphasizing the importance of understanding both the words and their meanings. The slide also touches upon the distinction between Nets for fish, which are easily forgotten, and Words for meaning, which can be more persistent in memory. This suggests that the lecture is focused on how semantic embeddings, like static and embedded vectors, play a crucial role in capturing and retaining the meaning of words in computational models.

Two words are similar in meaning if their context vectors are similar

times the row (target) word and the column (context) word co-occur in some context
in some training corpus. The context could be the document, in which case the cell
represents the number of times the two words appear in the same document. It is
most common, however, to use smaller contexts, generally a window around the
word, for example of 4 words to the left and 4 words to the right, in which case
the cell represents the number of times (in some training corpus) the column word
occurs in such a ±4 word window around the row word. For example here is one
example each of some words in their windows:

Cosine for computing word similarity


Computing word similarity: Dot product and cosine
The dot product between two vectors is a scalar:
The dot product tends to be high when the two 
vectors have large values in the same dimensions
Dot product can thus be a useful similarity metric 
between vectors
hence of length |V|, or both with documents as dimensions as documents, of length
|D|) and gives a measure of their similarity. By far the most common similarity
metric is the cosine of the angle between the vectors.
The cosine—like most measures for vector similarity used in NLP—is based on
the dot product operator from linear algebra, also called the inner product:
dot product(v,w) = v·w =
N
X
i=1
viwi = v1w1 +v2w2 +...+vNwN
(6.7)
As we will see, most metrics for similarity between vectors are based on the dot
product. The dot product acts as a similarity metric because it will tend to be high
just when the two vectors have large values in the same dimensions. Alternatively,
vectors that have zeros in different dimensions—orthogonal vectors—will have a


Problem with raw dot-product
Dot product favors long vectors
Dot product is higher if a vector is longer (has higher 
values in many dimension)

Frequent words (of, the, you) have long vectors (since 
 will see, most metrics for similarity between vectors are based on the dot

s that have zeros in different dimensions—orthogonal vectors—will have a
oduct of 0, representing their strong dissimilarity.

ectors. The vector length is defined as
|v| =
v

ot product is higher if a vector is longer, with higher values in each dimension.

The cosine similarity metric between two vectors~

For some applications we pre-normalize each vector, by dividing it by its length,
reating a unit vector of length 1. Thus we could compute a unit vector from ~
a by
ividing it by |~
a|. For unit vectors, the dot product is the same as the cosine.
This raw dot product, however, has a problem as a similarity metric: it favors
long vectors. The vector length is defined as
ector length
|v| =
v
u

i=1

(6.8)
The dot product is higher if a vector is longer, with higher values in each dimension.
More frequent words have longer vectors, since they tend to co-occur with more
words and have higher co-occurrence values with each of them. The raw dot product
thus will be higher for frequent words. But this is a problem; we’d like a similarity
metric that tells us how similar two words are regardless of their frequency.
We modify the dot product to normalize for the vector length by dividing the
dot product by the lengths of each of the two vectors. This normalized dot product
turns out to be the same as the cosine of the angle between the two vectors, following
from the definition of the dot product between two vectors a and b:
Based on the definition of the dot product between two vectors a and b

[IDS] The image is a slide from an NLP lecture that focuses on the concept of cosine as a similarity metric. It explains how cosine can be used to measure the similarity between vectors in a high-dimensional space. The slide provides two key points: 1) vectors pointing in opposite directions have a negative cosine value, and 2) vectors pointing in the same direction have a positive cosine value. It also mentions that since raw frequency values are non-negative, the cosine for term-term matrix vectors ranges from 0 to 1. This information is crucial for understanding how cosine can be applied in natural language processing tasks such as text classification or document clustering, where measuring the similarity between documents or terms is essential.

TF-IDF


But raw frequency is a bad representation
• The co-occurrence matrices we have seen represent each 
cell by word frequencies.
• Frequency is clearly useful; if sugar appears a lot near 
apricot, that's useful information.
• But overly frequent words like the, it, or they are not very 
informative about the context
• It's a paradox! How can we balance these two conflicting 
constraints? 


Two common solutions for word weighting
tf-idf:     tf-idf value for word t in document d:
PMI: (Pointwise mutual information)
◦PMI 𝒘𝟏, 𝒘𝟐= 𝒍𝒐𝒈
𝒑(𝒘𝟏,𝒘𝟐)
𝒑𝒘𝟏𝒑(𝒘𝟐)
fool
36
0.012
good
37
0
sweet
37
0
eighting of the value for word t in document d, wt,d thus combines
with idf:
wt,d = tft,d ⇥idft
(6.13)
f-idf weighting to the Shakespeare term-document matrix in Fig. 6.2.
idf values for the dimension corresponding to the word good have
 0; since this word appears in every document, the tf-idf algorithm
ored in any comparison of the plays. Similarly, the word fool, which
t of the 37 plays, has a much lower weight.
Words like "the" or "it" have very low idf

Term frequency (tf) in the tf-idf algorithm
We could imagine using raw count:
tft,d = count(t,d)
But instead of using raw count, we usually squash a bit:
tft,d = count(t,d)
e commonly we squash the raw frequency a bit, by using the l
ncy instead. The intuition is that a word appearing 100 times
sn’t make that word 100 times more likely to be relevant to the 
ument. We also need to do something special with counts of 0,
 the log of 0.2
tft,d =
(
1+log10 count(t,d)
if count(t,d) > 0


Document frequency (df)
dft is the number of documents t occurs in.
(note this is not collection frequency: total count across 
all documents)
"Romeo" is very distinctive for one Shakespeare play:
for discriminating those documents from the rest of the collection; terms that occur
frequently across the entire collection aren’t as helpful. The document frequency
nt
y
dft of a term t is the number of documents it occurs in. Document frequency is
not the same as the collection frequency of a term, which is the total number of
times the word appears in the whole collection in any document. Consider in the
collection of Shakespeare’s 37 plays the two words Romeo and action. The words
have identical collection frequencies (they both occur 113 times in all the plays) but
very different document frequencies, since Romeo only occurs in a single play. If
our goal is to find documents about the romantic tribulations of Romeo, the word
Romeo should be highly weighted, but not action:
Collection Frequency Document Frequency

action
113

Sparse versus dense vectors
tf-idf (or PMI) vectors are
◦long (length |V|= 20,000 to 50,000)
◦sparse (most elements are zero)
Alternative: learn vectors which are
◦short (length 50-1000)
◦dense (most elements are non-zero)


Sparse versus dense vectors
Why dense vectors?
◦Short vectors may be easier to use as features in machine 
learning (fewer weights to tune)
◦Dense vectors may generalize better than explicit counts
◦Dense vectors may do better at capturing synonymy:
◦car and automobile are synonyms; but are distinct dimensions
◦a word with car as a neighbor and a word with automobile as a 
neighbor should be similar, but aren't


Common methods for getting short dense vectors
“Neural Language Model”-inspired models
◦Word2vec (skipgram, CBOW), GloVe
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
◦A special case of this is called LSA – Latent Semantic 
Analysis
Alternative to these "static embeddings":
•
Contextual Embeddings (ELMo, BERT)
•
Compute distinct embeddings for a word in its context

Word2vec
Popular embedding method
Very fast to train
Code available on the web
Idea: predict rather than count
Word2vec provides various options. We'll do:
skip-gram with negative sampling (SGNS)


Word2vec
Instead of counting how often each word w occurs near "apricot"
◦Train a classifier on a binary prediction task:
◦Is w likely to show up near "apricot"?
We don’t actually care about this task
◦But we'll take the learned classifier weights as the word embeddings
Big idea:  self-supervision: 
◦A word c that occurs near apricot in the corpus cats as the gold "correct 
answer" for supervised learning


Approach: predict if candidate word c is a "neighbor"
1. Treat the target word t and a neighboring context word c
as positive examples.
2. Randomly sample other words in the lexicon to get 
negative examples
3. Use logistic regression to train a classifier to distinguish 
those two cases
4. Use the learned weights as the embeddings


Skip-Gram Training Data
Assume a +/- 2 word window, given training sentence:
…lemon, a [tablespoon of  apricot  jam,   a]  pinch…
c1                   c2 
c3      c4
 
                                [target]


Skip-Gram Classifier
(assuming a +/- 2 word window)
…lemon, a [tablespoon of  apricot  jam,   a]  pinch…
c1                   c2 [target]
c3      c4
Goal: train a classifier that is given a candidate (word, context) pair
(apricot, jam)
(apricot, aardvark)
…
And assigns each pair a probability:
P(+|w, c) 


Similarity is computed from dot product
Remember: two vectors are similar if they have a high 
dot product
◦Cosine is just a normalized dot product
So:
◦Similarity(w,c)  ∝w · c
We’ll need to normalize to get a probability 
◦(cosine isn't a probability either)


Turning dot products into probabilities
Sim(w,c) ≈ w · c
To turn this into a probability 
We'll use the sigmoid from logistic regression:

also need the total probability of the two possible events (c is a context
isn’t a context word) to sum to 1. We thus estimate the probability that 
a real context word for w as:
P(−|w,c) = 1−P(+|w,c)


How Skip-Gram Classifier computes P(+|w, c) 
This is for one context word, but we have lots of context words.
We'll assume independence and just multiply them:

We model the probability that word c is a real context word for target word w as:
P(+|w,c) = s(c·w) =
1
1+exp(−c·w)
(6.28)
The sigmoid function returns a number between 0 and 1, but to make it a probability
we’ll also need the total probability of the two possible events (c is a context word,
and c isn’t a context word) to sum to 1. We thus estimate the probability that word c
is not a real context word for w as:
P(−|w,c) = 1−P(+|w,c)
= s(−c·w) =
1
1+exp(c·w)
(6.29)
Equation 6.28 gives us the probability for one word, but there are many context
P(−|w,c) = 1−P(+|w,c)
= s(−c·w) =
1
1+exp(c·w)
(6.29)
uation 6.28 gives us the probability for one word, but there are many context
rds in the window. Skip-gram makes the simplifying assumption that all context
rds are independent, allowing us to just multiply their probabilities:

Word2vec: how to learn vectors
Given the set of positive and negative training instances, 
and an initial set of embedding vectors 
The goal of learning is to adjust those word vectors such 
that we:
◦Maximize the similarity of the target word, context word pairs 
(w , cpos) drawn from the positive data
◦Minimize the similarity of the (w , cneg) pairs drawn from the 
. 


Loss function for one w with cpos , cneg1 ...cnegk
Maximize the similarity of the target with the actual context words, 
and minimize the similarity of the target with the k negative sampled 
non-neighbor words. 
• Minimize the similarity of the (w,cneg) pairs from the negative examples.
If we consider one word/context pair (w,cpos) with its k noise words cneg1...cnegk,
we can express these two goals as the following loss function L to be minimized
(hence the −); here the first term expresses that we want the classifier to assign the
real context word cpos a high probability of being a neighbor, and the second term
expresses that we want to assign each of the noise words cnegi a high probability of
being a non-neighbor, all multiplied because we assume independence:

[IDS] The image is a slide from a lecture on Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically discussing gradient descent in the context of static embedding and vector semantic embeddings. The slide emphasizes the importance of understanding how gradients influence the learning process, particularly in relation to the loss function's direction and magnitude. It also highlights the role of a learning rate and its impact on the speed of convergence during the learning process. This concept is crucial for NLP tasks that involve training models with embeddings, as it helps in optimizing the model's parameters for better performance in tasks such as language modeling or sentiment analysis.

Properties of Embeddings


The kinds of neighbors depend on window size
Small windows (C= +/- 2) : nearest words are syntactically 
similar words in same taxonomy
◦Hogwarts nearest neighbors are other fictional schools
◦Sunnydale, Evernight, Blandings
Large windows (C= +/- 5) :  nearest words are related 
words in same semantic field
◦Hogwarts nearest neighbors are Harry Potter world:


Analogy/Relational Similarity:
Another semantic property of embeddings is their
ability to capture relational meanings. In an important early vector space model of
cognition, Rumelhart and Abrahamson (1973) proposed the parallelogram model
for solving simple analogy problems of the form a is to b as a* is to what?. In such
problems, a system given a problem like apple:tree::grape:?, i.e., apple is to tree as
grape is to
, and must fill in the word vine. In the parallelogram model, illus-
trated in Fig. 6.15, the vector from the word apple to the word tree (= #       »
apple−#   »
tree)
is added to the vector for grape (#        »
grape); the nearest word to that point is returned.
tree
apple
Analogical relations
The classic parallelogram model of analogical reasoning 
(Rumelhart and Abrahamson 1973)
To solve: "apple is to tree as grape is to  _____"
Add tree – apple  to grape to get vine


Analogical relations via parallelogram
The parallelogram method can solve analogies with 
both sparse and dense embeddings (Turney and 
Littman 2005, Mikolov et al. 2013b)
king – man + woman is close to queen
Paris – France + Italy is close to Rome
For a problem a:a*::b:b*, the parallelogram method is:
meaning could solve such analogy problems (Turney and Littman
arallelogram method received more modern attention because of
word2vec or GloVe vectors (Mikolov et al. 2013b, Levy and Gold
ngton et al. 2014). For example, the result of the expression (#    
kin
»
n is a vector close to #         »
queen. Similarly, #      »
Paris −#           »
France + #     »
Italy) 
 that is close to #         »
Rome. The embedding model thus seems to be ex
ations of relations like MALE-FEMALE, or CAPITAL-CITY-OF, or
TIVE/SUPERLATIVE, as shown in Fig. 6.16 from GloVe.
or a a:b::a*:b* problem, meaning the algorithm is given a, b, and 
*, the parallelogram method is thus:


Structure in GloVE Embedding space

[IDS] The image depicts a visualization of word embeddings, which are vectors that represent words in a high-dimensional space. In this context, the lecture is likely discussing static embeddings, which are fixed representations of words and do not change over time. The GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) embedding model is known for its ability to capture semantic relationships between words. This plot shows how words with similar meanings or usage patterns are closer together in the vector space, such as 'niece' and 'aunt', indicating their relatedness in the context of family relationships. The x-axis and y-axis represent the dimensions of the vector space where each word is plotted, showing the distribution of these words within the semantic space. [IDE]


Caveats with the parallelogram method
It only seems to work for frequent words, small 
distances and certain relations (relating countries to 
capitals, or parts of speech), but not others. (Linzen
2016, Gladkova et al. 2016, Ethayarajh et al. 2019a) 
Understanding analogy is an open area of research 
(Peterson et al. 2020)


Train embeddings on different decades of historical text to see meanings shift
~30 million books, 1850-1990, Google Books data
Embeddings as a window onto historical semantics

[IDS] The image represents a visual explanation of how word embeddings, specifically static and diachronic embeddings, reveal semantic changes in language over time. The left part of the image illustrates static embeddings by showing words like "gay" and "gays" with arrows pointing to their meanings. The right part of the image demonstrates diachronic embeddings, which track changes in meaning over time. The example given is the word "awful," which has shifted from a positive to a negative connotation between 1850 and 1990. This kind of analysis helps in understanding how language evolves and how certain words can change their meaning based on societal shifts and historical context. In an NLP lecture, this would be an important topic as it showcases how computational models can capture and analyze linguistic changes to improve natural language processing tasks. [IDE]


Embeddings reflect cultural bias!
Ask “Paris : France :: Tokyo : x” 
◦x = Japan
Ask “father : doctor :: mother : x” 
◦x = nurse
Ask “man : computer programmer :: woman : x” 
◦x = homemaker
Bolukbasi, Tolga, Kai-Wei Chang, James Y. Zou, Venkatesh Saligrama, and Adam T. Kalai. "Man is to computer 
programmer as woman is to homemaker? debiasing word embeddings." In NeurIPS, pp. 4349-4357. 2016.


Historical embedding as a tool to study cultural biases
• Compute a gender or ethnic bias for each adjective: e.g., how 
much closer the adjective is to "woman" synonyms than 
"man" synonyms, or names of particular ethnicities
• Embeddings for competence adjective (smart, wise, 
brilliant, resourceful, thoughtful, logical) are biased toward 
men, a bias slowly decreasing 1960-1990
• Embeddings for dehumanizing adjectives (barbaric, 
monstrous, bizarre)  were biased toward Asians in the 
Garg, N., Schiebinger, L., Jurafsky, D., and Zou, J. (2018). Word embeddings quantify 100 years of gender and ethnic stereotypes.

• Issues?
• Only works for fixed length inputs!
• In this case: 3 words
• Workarounds?
• Set input size to fixed length (e.g., that of longest review)
• Pad shorter with 0 vectors
• Truncate longer ones
• Create single fixed size review embedding (sentence / paragraph / document)

Simple Text Classifiers: More Classes

Simple Language Modeling Task


Neural Language Models (LMs)
Language Modeling: Calculating the probability of the 
next word in a sequence given some history. 
•
We've seen N-gram based LMs
•
But neural network LMs far outperform n-gram 
language models
State-of-the-art neural LMs are based on more 
powerful neural network technology like Transformers
But simple feedforward LMs can do almost as well!


Simple feedforward Neural Language Models
Task: predict next word wt 
 
 
  given prior words wt-1, wt-2, wt-3, …
Problem: Now we’re dealing with sequences of 
arbitrary length.
Solution: Sliding windows (of fixed length)

[IDS] In the context of a lecture on NLP, we are discussing the concept of predicting the next word in a sequence given prior words, which is a common task in language modeling. The lecture emphasizes the use of simple feedforward neural language models to solve this problem. The solution presented involves sliding windows of fixed length, indicating that the model considers a certain number of preceding words to predict the next one. This approach is essential for understanding how neural networks can be trained to generate coherent text or respond appropriately in natural language processing tasks. [IDE]


Neural Language Model 

[IDS] The image represents a fundamental concept in Natural Language Processing (NLP) known as Feedforward Neural Language Models. These models are designed to process and understand human language by learning from large datasets of text. The diagram illustrates the architecture of such a model, which typically consists of an input layer that accepts text data, multiple hidden layers where complex patterns are detected, and an output layer that generates predictions or continuations of the input text. In this specific model, there's also a projection layer and an embedding layer for word representations, which are crucial for capturing the semantic meaning of words. The presence of mathematical notations like p(z|...), p(for|...), and V×1 indicates the probabilistic nature of these models and their focus on statistical prediction. This type of model is widely used in applications such as language translation, speech recognition, and text generation. [IDE]


Why Neural LMs work better than N-gram LMs
Training data:
We've seen:  I have to make sure that the cat gets fed. 
Never seen:   dog gets fed
Test data:
I forgot to make sure that the dog gets ___
N-gram LM can't predict "fed"!
Neural LM can use similarity of "cat" and "dog" 
embeddings to generalize and predict “fed” after dog

What do we need them for? (I/II)
Fig. 1: High level representation of an encoder

General case: 
We need RNNs for representing a sequence of variable length as a single 
vector (encoder) OR generating a sequence of variable length from a 
single vector (decoder)

[IDS] In the context of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) lecture, this image represents the concept of using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for tasks in NLP. RNNs are a type of neural network architecture that is particularly well-suited for processing sequences of data, such as text or speech. The diagram illustrates how an RNN can be used to generate a sequence of variable length from a single vector (encoder) or by encoding a sequence of variable length as a single vector (decoder). This process involves taking input sequences of varying lengths and converting them into a fixed-size representation that can be processed by the model. The figure shows the flow of information from the input sequence through the RNN, which generates an output vector (latent representation), indicating how the RNN processes and encodes the input data in NLP applications. [IDE]



What do we need them for? (II/II)
Fig. 2: High level representation of a decoder

[IDS] In the context of a lecture on Recurrent Neural Networks for Natural Language Processing (NLP), the image illustrates the process of generating text using an RNN. The input vector represents the initial state or prompt that the decoder will use to generate the output sequence. The high-level representation shows the flow from the input to the final output, emphasizing how the RNN processes and generates text based on the input provided. This is a fundamental concept in NLP, where RNNs are trained to understand and produce human-like language. [IDE]



Types of RNNs relevant to us

Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)

[IDS] The image is a slide from a lecture on Natural Language Processing (NLP) that focuses on the application of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in this field. The title "Types of RNNs relevant to us" suggests that the slide will discuss specific types of RNNs that are particularly useful or interesting for NLP tasks. Two examples provided are "Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)" and "Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)", which are both architectures of RNNs known for their ability to handle sequences of data, like text or speech. These architectures are essential for tasks such as language modeling, machine translation, and text generation. The logos at the bottom indicate that the lecture might be part of a course offered by Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg and is related to Fachbereich Informatik, which translates to Faculty of Computer Science. This suggests an academic setting where students are likely learning about the theoretical and practical aspects of using RNNs in NLP. [IDE]



Gated Recurrent Unit
Fig. 3.1: High level represenation of GRU cell

[IDS] The image depicts a fundamental component of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). In the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP) lectures, GRUs are a type of RNN that can handle variable-length sequences, making them suitable for tasks such as language modeling or sequence prediction. The diagram illustrates how the GRU processes information through gates, which control the flow of information and help in learning long-term dependencies in data. This is crucial for NLP applications where understanding context over long sequences is essential. The presence of Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg and Fachbereich Informatik suggests that this image may be part of educational material from an informatics department, emphasizing the practical application of GRUs in NLP tasks. [IDE]



Gated Recurrent Unit

Hidden states

[IDS] The image is a visual representation of a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), which is a type of recurrent neural network architecture. In the context of NLP, or Natural Language Processing, GRUs are commonly used for modeling sequences in data, such as text or speech. The diagram shows how the hidden states are passed through time, allowing the model to remember and utilize information from previous time steps. This is particularly useful in NLP tasks where understanding the context and dependencies between words is crucial. The lecture you're attending is likely discussing how these GRUs can be applied to NLP problems, leveraging their ability to capture long-term dependencies and handle variable-length input sequences. [IDE]



Gated Recurrent Unit

Output of the previous time 
step. ht=0 = [0, …, 0]

[IDS] The image depicts a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), which is a type of recurrent neural network architecture. In the context of NLP, or Natural Language Processing, GRUs are often used to process sequential data, such as text or speech. They are designed to handle the vanishing gradient problem that can occur in traditional RNNs by using gating mechanisms. These gates help control the flow of information through the network, allowing it to remember important information for longer periods. The diagram shows how the output at one time step is determined by the input at the current time step and the hidden state from the previous time step, illustrating the sequence-to-sequence nature of GRUs in NLP tasks.

The outputs from the forward and backward passes are then concatenated at each time point to provide a richer context to the model.

The diagram shows two RNNs running in opposite directions, labeled as "RNN 1" and "RNN 2". Each RNN processes the input sequence from different ends - "RNN 1" from left to right and "RNN 2" from right to left. The outputs of these two RNNs are then combined at each time point, as indicated by the yellow rectangles, which represent the concatenation of outputs.

This architecture allows the model to capture dependencies in the input sequence from both directions, making it useful for tasks such as language translation, text classification, and machine reading comprehension.

[IDS] The image displays a comparison between two types of neural network architectures used in natural language processing (NLP): Transformer and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network). The Transformer is characterized by its fixed sequence length and self-attention mechanism, which allows it to process input data in parallel. It is described as being infinite in theory, suggesting that it can handle sequences of any length. On the other hand, RNNs are known for their ability to parse input sequences one at a time, with attention mechanisms that focus on specific parts of the input. This table provides a concise overview of the fundamental differences between these two NLP models, which are essential for understanding recent advances in the field. [IDE]



Tokenization

Word2Vec: One token per word (word == token)

FastText: One token per subword. Subword is character N-Gram.
Example: Use 3 and 4-Grams of a word. Word: “School”
’school’ → ['sch', 'cho', 'hoo', 'ool', 'scho', 'choo', 'hool']

FastText of Word2Vec:
- Word2Vec has fewer tokens

Add special tokens to the text

[CLS] – Special token at the start of each input sequence. The embedding for this will often be 
used for classification. Learns information about the whole sequence.

[PAD] – We always feed a fixed length sequence of text. Usually our input sequence is smaller 
and needs to be padded to have this length. This is done by the padding token.

[SEP] – We might feed several sentences or documents to the model. Each of them is 
separated by the separator token.

[MASK] – During training we might want to hide tokens and predict them. These are replaced 
with the mask token

This process involves covering parts of the input sequence with special tokens like [CLS] and [PAD], which serve as placeholders for missing information or padding. These masks are essential for training models that can predict missing words or handle sequences of different lengths. The image provides a visual representation of how this technique is applied to the input sequence "I like cake," showing the masked version as "[CLS] K I like V [PAD] [PAD] [PAD]". The lecture likely explains the benefits of this technique, such as allowing the model to learn without relying on the exact word order and improving its ability to generalize to unseen data. [IDE]



Masking

[IDS] The image represents a concept in NLP known as "Masking," specifically related to the Transformer Encoder architecture. In this context, masking is used to create a target sequence for training sequence-to-sequence models like translation or summarization. The goal is to generate a target sequence that corresponds to the input sequence, but with some information removed (masked) to challenge the model and improve its ability to predict the missing information. This process is crucial for training effective models that can handle real-world tasks where not all information is available. The diagram visually demonstrates how certain positions in the input sequence are masked, leading to an incomplete sequence that the model must learn to predict. [IDE]



Masking
-infinity becomes 0. Scores sum up to 1.

[IDS] The image is a visual representation of the masking technique used in Transformer models, specifically within the encoder component. This technique is crucial for preventing the model from seeing the future tokens during training, which would make it impossible to learn any form of sequence modeling. The mask is applied to the attention mechanism of the Transformer, where the masked positions are replaced with a special token (often referred to as the 'pad' token) and the original values are stored elsewhere. During the training phase, the model learns to predict these masks based on the context provided by the surrounding tokens. The softmax function is then applied to ensure that the probabilities sum up to 1. This process is essential for training transformer-based language models like BERT, GPT, and others, which rely on self-attention mechanisms to understand the context of words within sentences.

By masking certain positions in the input sequence, the model can learn to focus on relevant information without being influenced by the context provided by future tokens. This is essential for training models that need to predict or generate sequences where the order of tokens matters.

[IDS] The image depicts the Encoder part of a Transformer model, which is a fundamental component in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The Encoder is responsible for processing input sequences, such as sentences or paragraphs, and generating a continuous representation known as the "sum of embeddings." This process involves multi-head self-attention mechanisms that allow the model to capture dependencies between different parts of the input sequence. The resulting embeddings are then passed through feed-forward layers to further transform them. In this diagram, the Encoder is shown to consist of multiple layers, each containing attention and feed-forward components, with the output of the Encoder being fed back into it, indicating the self-attention mechanism. This architecture enables the Transformer model to understand the context and relationships within the input text, which is crucial for tasks such as language translation, question answering, and text summarization.

[IDS] The image is a visual representation of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, which is a popular architecture in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers and it's a type of transformer-based neural network. It uses an encoder to process sequences of tokens, both left-to-right and right-to-left, allowing it to take into account context from both sides of a word or phrase. The goal of BERT is to improve the performance of NLP tasks by providing better representations of words in context.

In the diagram, we can see the different components of BERT, such as the masked sentence A and B pair, which are used during pre-training to teach the model about the context of words. The "NSP" and "Mask LM" arrows represent two key training tasks: Next Sentence Prediction and Masked Language Modeling, respectively. These tasks help the model understand relationships between sentences and predict missing words in a given context.

The figure caption mentions "BERT architecture (l) (source: own)" indicating that this specific visualization might be based on the creator's interpretation or adaptation of the original BERT architecture. The source "own" suggests that the creator of this image has made some modifications or additions to the original BERT architecture diagram.
